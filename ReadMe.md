"Everything is related. Near things are more related than distant things." - Waldo Tobler's First Law of Geography

Everything exists or occurs somewhere and that 'somewhere' has important implications for understanding the world and it's processes. Many research questions have an explicitly spatial component (i.e. "X tends to happen more often when Y is near a Z."), but students and researchers are often not familiar enough with spatial data formats, fundamentals and methods to leverage the spatial components of their research.

The Stanford Geospatial Center proposes to add a series of modules/exercises to introduce the basics of spatial data exploration, collection and analysis in a field setting. The objective is to build foundational understanding of spatial data collection, management and analysis methods and build the spatial data literacy skills necessary to leverage 'where' in their research. 

Exercises will make use of existing Wrigley field sites, including those currently used in the the **Volcanic Flows and Succession Studies** module and the **Experimental Traditional Dry-land Agriculture**, complementing those modules with digital methods for reconnaissance, data collection, analysis and management. Exercises will include methods for delineating geologic features using multispectral imagery, use of GIS for measurement and statistical summary, creation of landcover data, methods of ground-truthing and vector/raster data extraction.

##Proposed Modules

###Module 1: Introduction to Spatial Data and Basic Spatial Analysis (3 hours)
A series of lectures, demos and exercises designed to introduce the basic concepts of spatial data analysis in a geographic information system. QGIS, an Open Source desktop GIS (Windows, OSX, Linux, Android) program will be used. 
####Topics:  
* What is a Geographic Information System?
* How does GIS organize the world?
* How does GIS locate data on the Earth?
* Spatial data formats
* What does GIS enable?
* Installation of QGIS
* Basic features of a GIS
* Exploring Data
* Selecting/subsetting by Attributes
* Table Joins
* Filtering
* Basic visualization using Symbology
* Labeling
* Creating a map layout  

###Module 2: Geoprocessing of Spatial Data (3 hours)
A series of demonstrations and exercises designed to continue the introduction to spatial analysis and familiarize students with some of the most common spatial analysis and measurement techniques and concepts.
####Topics:
* Basic attribute statistics
