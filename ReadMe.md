#Stanford Wrigley Field Program in Hawaii Spatial Analysis Module

A Three Day series of workshops/exercises to introduce the basics of spatial data exploration, collection and analysis in a field setting.

##Proposed Modules
##Day 1
###Module 1: Introduction to Spatial Data and Basic Spatial Analysis (3 hours)
A series of lectures, demos and exercises designed to introduce the basic concepts of spatial data analysis in a geographic information system. QGIS, an Open Source desktop GIS (Windows, OSX, Linux, Android) program will be used. 
####Topics:  
* What is a Geographic Information System?
* How does GIS organize the world?
* How does GIS locate data on the Earth?
* Spatial data formats
* What does GIS enable?
* Installation of QGIS
* Basic features of a GIS
* Exploring Data
* Selecting/subsetting by Attributes
* Table Joins
* Filtering
* Basic visualization using Symbology
* Labeling
* Creating a map layout  

###Module 2: Geoprocessing of Spatial Data (3 hours)
A series of demonstrations and exercises designed to introduce some of the most common spatial analysis and measurement techniques.
####Topics:
* Basic attribute statistics
* Spatial allocation
* Spatial Joins
* Summary Statistics
* Basic point pattern analysis
* Spatial central tendency
* Overlay analysis
* Spatial measurement
* Calculations in the Attribute Table
* Proximity
* K Nearest Neighbor analysis
* Geocoding and conversion of tabular data to spatial data
* Relation database models for spatial analysis  

##Day 2
###Module 3: Introduction to Raster and Satellite Remote Sensing (3 hours)
